A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is a cyberattack where an attacker inserts themselves into the communication between two parties.

Developed machine learning model for detection  of Man in the Middle(MITM) attacks in V2G network.

The Gradient Boosting model performs best with 98% overall accuracy in detecting mul
tiple MitM attack groups.
